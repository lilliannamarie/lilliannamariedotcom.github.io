   <!-- Hello, you are now inside of my <head>. This is no longer Squarespace. 
    I learned a little bit of HTML, quit Squarespace, and built my own tiny thing. 
    It is very simple, and perfect for me right now. It reminds me a little of 
    Antoine de Saint Exupéry's sentiments in Terre des Hommes: "Il semble que la 
    perfection soit atteinte non quand il n'y a plus rien à ajouter, mais quand il 
    n'y a plus rien à retrancher." I don't know the anonymous Internet travelers 
    who visit my web address; I do not know who, specifically, you are that is reading 
    this right now. Nevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, 
    in the abstract, for your interest in my creative work; 
    I hope you have a really wonderful day. Sincerely, Lillianna. -->
